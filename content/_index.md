        There remain opportunities for safe learning in a boarder class of systems
        and the safe certificate has not been fully developed. Thus, the primary objective of this research is
        to advance the field by enhancing the safety of robot control in environments characterized by time-
        variant and contact-rich conditions. This enhancement will be achieved through the application of
        reinforcement learning techniques, coupled with the development and utilization of safety certificates.
